## Metamask snaps

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities
of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that is run in an isolated environment that
can customize the wallet experience. For detailed
instructions, see [the MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html#serving-a-snap-to-your-local-environment).

### Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and
fix any automatically fixable issues.

### Using NPM packages with scripts

Scripts are disabled by default for security reasons. If you need to use NPM
packages with scripts, you can run `yarn allow-scripts auto`, and enable the
script in the `lavamoat.allowScripts` section of `package.json`.
